# Getting started

## Introduction

OCA is a pattern (architecture) that defines a new representation of data semantics. Official OCA documentation is under development hosted by [Human Colossus Foundation](https://humancolossus.foundation). For years concept of OCA was incubated within communities like [Inputs and Semantics Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+and+Semantics+Working+Group) at [Trust over IP](https://trustoverip.org/working-groups/decentralized-semantics/). And Hyperledger Aries [RFC-0014](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0013-overlays).

Developers can follow current specification work in the [official repository](https://the-human-colossus-foundation.github.io/oca-spec/).

Due to a rapidly-evolving OCA core specification, future implementations may differ somewhat. The most up to date implementation is Rust, which would provide bindings to other languages.

- [Rust](https://github.com/THCLab/oca-rust)
- Deprecated: ~~[Kotlin](https://github.com/THCLab/oca-kotlin) with compile target to JavaScript~~
- Deprecated: ~~[Ruby](https://github.com/THCLab/oca-ruby)~~


Those core libraries allow the creation, parsing and management of OCA objects.

## OCA libraries

For simplified integration, the community continues to build libraries that use OCA in different frameworks, networks, and other ecosystems. OCA integration into enterprise systems can happen through those libraries.

- [oca-form](https://github.com/THCLab/oca-form): a library containing Vue components to enable OCA objects to resolve in Vue system applications efficiently. This library powers the [OCA Editor](https://editor.oca.argo.colossi.network/) and is used in the HCF [Aries Toolbox](https://github.com/THCLab/tda-web-client) modification to demonstrate safe and secure data flows.

## OCA Ecosystem

We have built a suite of tools and components to enable broad adoption of the architecture to facilitate implementations in a production environment. OCA core requirements continue to evolve in line with the development of these middleware assets.

### OCA Repository

OCA Repository is a component for storing and sharing OCA objects freely. True
object interoperability suggests that an object's storage location needs not to
be the primary focus but instead the file content. OCA follows a [content
centric networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_centric_networking)
(CCN) approach with a [Self-Addressing Identifiers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ssmith-said) (SAID)
referencing each object.

OCA Repository is decentralised by nature, synchronised with other components to enable OCA objects' searchability in a distributed ecosystem.

An OCA repository can be a public-access or private-access repository for storing OCA objects.

Elastic search powers the current repository implementation and exposes a simple API (see [OpenAPI Spec](https://repository.oca.argo.colossi.network/)) to the user.

### OCA Data Vault


OCA Data Vault is a simple PoC data storage implementation showcasing how to consume and provide data described by OCA.

This project implementation is for showcasing purposes only, not for production systems or real-life use cases.

## OCA Tools

HCF has facilitated the development of a set of tools to make OCA integration easier for developers.

### OCA Editor

OCA Editor is an easy-to-use middleware solution to enable users to create, modify and manage OCA objects. The core development team created the tool with non-technical people in mind. Through a 'drag and drop' approach, anyone can create and publish OCA schemas. We highly recommend building OCA schemas via this editor as the first port-of-call.

## OCA playground

OCA can be tested and developed on Argo, a dedicated sandbox environment hosted by Human Colossus Foundation.
